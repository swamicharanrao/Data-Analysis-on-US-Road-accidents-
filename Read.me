Data Analysis of US Road Accidents (2016-2023)

Overview: This project involves the analysis of US accident data from the years 2016 to 2023. The dataset is explored to identify key patterns and trends in accident occurrence, severity, and geographical distribution. This project uses Python for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, and the results are presented in the form of graphs and insights derived from the dataset.

Features:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, filtering unnecessary data, and cleaning the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering trends, distributions, and correlations in the data through various visualizations.
Distribution of accidents by year, month, day, and hour.
Analysis of accident severity and its distribution across states.
Geographic analysis of accident hotspots based on latitude and longitude data.
Visualizations: Bar charts, line plots, pie charts, and histograms are used to visualize the data.

Dataset: The dataset used in this analysis contains information about road accidents in the US from 2016 to 2023.
